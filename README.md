# Fisher-s-Iris-Data-Set-2019

The Iris data set concerns 150 flowers irises, which are described 4 traits (conditional attributes): length and width of the petal,
and length and width of the stem. In addition, we have an attribute decision-making (class) which takes three possible values: 
"Iris-setosa", "Iris-Versicolor" and "Iris-virginica", which divide a set of 50 observations for each of these classes (33.3%).
