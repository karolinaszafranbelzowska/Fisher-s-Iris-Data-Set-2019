This repository contains my solutions to the "Problem Set 2019" for the module "Programming and Scripting" at GMIT.
See here for the instructions : https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/problems-pands-2019/raw/master/problems.pdf 
The Iris data set concerns 150 flowers irises, which are described 4 traits (conditional attributes): length and width of the petal,
and length and width of the stem. In addition, we have an attribute decision-making (class) which takes three possible values: 
"Iris-setosa", "Iris-Versicolor" and "Iris-virginica", which divide a set of 50 observations for each of these classes (33.3%).

Numbers of instances: 150 (50 in each of three classes)

Numbers of attributes: 4 numeric and 3 classes

Attribute information:
1. Sepal length in cm,
2. Sepal width in cm,
3. Petal length in cm,
4. Petal width in cm,
5. and classes: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour, Iris Virginica

## What each file contains
 
### iris_data_set.py 
contains Python code to show the whole Iris Flower Data Set in file.  This file stores tabular data in plain text. Each line of the file is a data record. Each record consists of one or more fields, separated by commas. The data which is called "The Iris flower data set" or "Fisher's Iris data set" is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald  Fisher in his 1936.
